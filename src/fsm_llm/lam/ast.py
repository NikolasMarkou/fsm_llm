"""
Typed λ-AST nodes for the M1 kernel.

All nodes are frozen Pydantic v2 ``BaseModel`` instances (D-003): immutable,
serialisable via ``model_dump`` / ``model_validate``, and hashable by
structure. The recursive types are resolved with ``model_rebuild()`` at the
end of the module, mirroring the pattern used in ``fsm_llm.definitions``
for the ``FSMDefinition → State → Transition`` cycle.

Node taxonomy (closed set):

- ``Var(name)``              — variable reference, resolved in the executor
                               environment.
- ``Abs(param, body)``       — λ-abstraction.
- ``App(fn, arg)``            — application.
- ``Let(name, value, body)``  — sugar for ``App(Abs(name, body), value)``,
                               kept as its own node so serialised terms
                               remain readable.
- ``Case(scrutinee, branches, default=None)``
                              — finite discrimination; scrutinee must
                               evaluate to a value in ``branches`` or
                               ``default`` must be set.
- ``Combinator(op, args)``    — one of the 7 library combinators. ``op``
                               is a closed ``CombinatorOp`` enum (I2).
- ``Fix(body)``               — bounded recursion; ``body`` is an ``Abs``
                               whose single parameter receives the
                               recursive binding.
- ``Leaf(template, input_vars, schema=None)``
                              — the ONLY node that invokes 𝓜 (I1).
                               Carries a prompt template, the env var
                               names to substitute, and an optional
                               structured-output schema (referenced by
                               fully-qualified name so the AST remains
                               picklable — ``BaseModel`` classes themselves
                               are not round-trip-serialisable through
                               ``model_dump``).

The ``schema`` field on ``Leaf`` is ``str | None`` — a dotted path to a
Pydantic model. The executor resolves it at oracle-dispatch time. Carrying
a class object here would break JSON round-trip (SC3).
