      "description": "Examine the problem from multiple, diverse, and unusual viewpoints to break free from conventional thinking.",
      "purpose": "Look at the problem from at least three different and unconventional angles or perspectives. This could involve considering it from the viewpoint of a child, an alien, an artist, an engineer from 100 years ago, or by using analogies from completely unrelated fields. The goal is to reframe the problem. Store these 'perspectives' (list of brief descriptions of each angle) and any 'reframings' (how the problem looks from these new angles).",

      "purpose": "Generate a multitude of creative ideas (at least 5-7) based on the explored perspectives and reframings. Encourage 'wild' or seemingly impractical ideas at this stage, as they can spark more viable solutions. Do not filter or judge for feasibility yet. Store these as 'creative_ideas' (a list of concise idea descriptions) and any 'unconventional_approaches' (brief notes on the thinking that led to them).",

      "instructions": "Think divergently. What are some out-of-the-box solutions? What if you had unlimited resources, or very few? What if the laws of physics were different? List all 'creative_ideas' and note any 'unconventional_approaches' used.",

      "purpose": "Take elements from the 'creative_ideas' and try to combine them in unexpected or interesting ways to create new, hybrid solutions. Aim for at least 2-3 distinct 'combinations'. Also, identify any emerging 'novel_solutions' that arise from this synthesis. The goal is to find synergy between previously separate ideas.",

Evaluate its 'innovation_rating' (e.g., low, medium, high, groundbreaking) based on its originality and potential impact. Briefly touch upon why it's innovative and what makes it promising, even if it needs further refinement for practicality.",
