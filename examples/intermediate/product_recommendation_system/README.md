# Product Recommendation System

This example demonstrates using LLM-FSM to create a decision-tree conversation flow that recommends technology products based on user preferences.

## Purpose

This example shows how to:
- Implement a branching decision tree for product recommendations
- Use conditional transitions to navigate different recommendation paths
- Extract and categorize user preferences
- Tailor recommendations based on collected preferences
- Create a conversational product advisor experience

## FSM Structure

This example implements a recommendation system with the following states:
1. **welcome**: Introduces the recommendation service
2. **device_type_selection**: Determines whether the user wants a smartphone or laptop
3. **smartphone_budget**: Determines budget range for smartphones
4. **laptop_budget**: Determines budget range for laptops
5. **recommend_budget_smartphone**: Provides budget smartphone recommendations
6. **recommend_premium_smartphone**: Provides premium smartphone recommendations
7. **recommend_budget_laptop**: Provides budget laptop recommendations
8. **recommend_premium_laptop**: Provides premium laptop recommendations
9. **end**: Concludes the conversation gracefully

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have LLM-FSM installed:
```bash
pip install llm-fsm
```

2. Set your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

3. Run the example:
```bash
python product_recommendation.py
```

4. To visualize the FSM structure (optional):
```bash
python fsm_visualizer.py
```

## Expected Output
